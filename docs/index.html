      <p>Long term, I plan for this page to be my fitness dashboard. For now, this page is mostly informational</p>
      <p>In particular, I get asked quite often on my opinion on X, on my approach of Y, and how I do Z. This page aims to summarize the resources I use and follow</p>

      <h3>My approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I eat everything I want, it's all about the total amount and the distribution of macros. I try to have about 75% of my meals to come from healthy sources</li>
        <li>I basically follow the If It Fits Your Macros approach, meaning you can eat basically anything, as long as you reach the goals for number of grams of carbs, protein and fat</li>
        <li>“Be strict with what you can control, so you can enjoy what you can’t control” (via <a href="http://physiqonomics.com/new-year-advice/" target="_blank">physiqonomics.com</a>): </li>
        <ul>
          <li>I aim to go to the gym every day. Realistically there is one day a week where you can't make it due to time constraints. By going every day by default, it feels less taxing, as it just becomes part of your daily routine</li>
          <li>If you eat at home during the day, eat healthy, cook yourself, so that when your friends invite you out for dinner, you can eat pretty much whatever you want</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In 2018 I tracked macros for about 75% of the days, nowadays it's more like 25% of the days</li>
        <li>The only thing people see all the time is the face. As soon as I gain fat, it's immediately visible on my jaw line. That's why I only do slow/lean bulks where I minimize the fat gain while gaining muscle</li>
        <li>Supplements (including protein powder) are unnecessary, besides vitamins I don't take any (<a href="https://rippedbody.com/complete-diet-nutrition-set-up-guide/#supplements" target="_blank">Source</a>)</li>
        <li>I never want fitness to get into the way of my life, meaning if I'm invited by friends, it doens't matter if they're going to a restaurant that only serves X, or if we're going out drinking. I don't believe in binary diets</li>
        <li>I use MyFitnessPal to track my food, it's a terrible app for many reasons, but it still has the best data out there. I haven't found a good alternative yet</li>
        <li>There is lots of misinformation around fitness, make sure to find trustworthy sources for your decisions to avoid making unnecessary sacrifices, some examples of myths:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Carbs are bad</li>
          <li>Meal timing is important, I need a shake after my workout</li>
          <li>BCAA drinks</li>
          <li>Cheat days (<a href="http://physiqonomics.com/cheat-day/" target="_blank">Source</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I drink quite a few light/zero products, they really have no kcal, and aren't really unhealthy in reasonable amounts (<a href="http://physiqonomics.com/aspartame" target="_blank">Source</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Tracking progress</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>I measure body fat with my personal trainer about twice a month (when I'm in NYC)</li>
          <li>I do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry" target="_blank">DEXA scan</a> 4 times a year (as it costs about $80 each time)</li>
          <li>I track my weight every day in the morning (unless I drank alcohol the night before) and use <a href="http://www.weightgrapher.com" target="_blank">weightgrapher.com</a> (no HTTPs website, make sure to use an auto-generated password) to get the 10d average weight, as well as 1w and 1m weight change</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I do a normal 3 day split:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Legs + Shoulder</li>
          <li>Chest + Bicep</li>
          <li>Back + Tricep</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I used to do powerlifting, and I still incorporate heavy deadlifts + squats into my workout routine, however I mostly stopped heavy bench as I reached the numbers I'm happy with</li>
        <li>Abs are made in the kitchen, I don't do any abs exercises</li>
        <li>You have to live like you have a sixpack to get a sixpack. This means, you'll have to build up the habits that will enable you to get and maintain one.</li>
        <li>I have no self control when it comes to certain snacks and sweets (Nutella anyone?). The best way to fight this is just to not have access to it, so I never buy those snacks</li>
        <li>I read this somewhere: If your dog gets fat, and you want it to lose weight, do you put it on Paleo, Atkins or Whole30 diet? No, you give it less food every day.</li>
        <li>When my grandmother bakes her famous cake, I for sure am gonna eat multiple pieces! Easy to do by making sure to stay on lower fat the day off and the next day</li>
        <li>Sugar isn't bad per-se. Just don't overdo it. I have most of my sugar intake right before and after my workout</li>
        <li>You can easily borrow ~20% of your macros from the previous and the next day. Especially when you go out, and you decide to eat a 2am pizza, just enter it in mfp, and have less food the next day</li>
      </ul>
